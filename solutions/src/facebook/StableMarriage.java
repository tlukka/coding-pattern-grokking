    // Stable Marriage Problem - Galeâ€“Shapley Algorithm (Deferred Acceptance algorithm)
    // Given N men and N women and the preference marriage order for each man and woman write an
    // algorithm to marry them in a manner so that their marriages are stable.

    // Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex in order of preference,
    // marry the men and women together such that there are no two people of the opposite sex who would both rather
    // have each other than their current partners. When there are no such pairs of people,
    // the set of marriages is deemed stable

    //There are 2 men (m1 and m2) and 2 women (w1 and w2). Marriage preference order is given below -

    //Preference order of m1 - [w1, w2]
    //Preference order of m2 - [w1, w2]
    //Preference order of w1 - [m1, m2]
    //Preference order of w2 - [m1, m2]

    //Possible couples for marriage (m1, w1) and (m2, w2) (m1, w2) and (m2, w1)

    //Couples (m1, w2) and (m2, w1) are not stable since m1 would prefer w1 over w2 (assigned to m1) similarly w1
    // would prefer m1 over m2 (assigned to w1).
    // On the other hand couples (m1, w1) and (m2, w2) are stable since there are no two people of the opposite sex
    // who would both rather have each other than their current partners. Let's see what are other two people of
    // the opposite sex (m1, w2) and (m2, w1). In (m1, w2), w2 would prefer m1 but m1 would not prefer w2 over w1
    // (assigned to m1) and similarly in (m2, w1), m2 would prefer w1 but w1 would not prefer m2 over m1
    // (assigned to w1) so (m1, w1) and (m2, w2) are stable couple.
