    // Given an array of integers nums. Find lucky numbers in that array and if multiple such numbers found,
    // return max. If none found, return -1. A number is lucky if it occurs that many times in the array.
    //
    //Eg., [1,2,2,3,3,3] Output: 3.

    // Youâ€™re given a sequence of digits. Find the count of all contiguous subsequences that make a magical sequence.
    // A magical sequence passes the following test:
    //
    //From the last digit, and moving left, double the value of every alternate digit.
    // If the result of this operation is two digit number, then add the digits (e.g., 18: 1 + 8 = 9).
    //
    //Sum up all the digits.
    //
    //Resultant sum is divisible by 10.
    //
    //Input Format
    //The first line of input consists of an integer t denoting the number of test cases.
    // The first line of each test case contains the length of the sequence d.
    // This is followed by a sequence containing d digits.
    //
    //Output Format
    //For each case output the count of all magical sequences.

    // Given two strings source and target, return a list of minimum edits required to convert source to target.
    //An edit is removal from source or addition to target or the common character if the characters are equal.
    // In case of multiple answers, prefer removing from source. (https://www.techiedelight.com/implement-diff-utility)
    //
    //When removing a character from source to get to target , append it with '-'.
    //When adding a character to get to target , append it with '+'.
    //When characters are same, add it as it is.
    //For example, source = "pop", and target = "tops"
    //ans: [+t, -p, o, p, +s]

    // print all the subsequences of the array having sum k?
    // Given a string, output the run length encoding of that string so that repeat letters are compressed to the character and count.
